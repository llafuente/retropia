# Retropia

A console spec collection

This projects aim is to gather all information about consoles I need for my
mods and my projects.

Console mods to do:
* TOSLINK optical audio
* Scart RGB
* 60hz mod if PAL

At first all info will be from external sources I will add my own material
when needed :)

Another project in mind is to transform all controllers to wireless.
I have been lucky with very simple staff like sega master system and genesis
(megadrive). The range I aim is nes/master system to ps3/xbox generation.
Dreamcast VMU and N64 memory are the real problems atm. Still researching!
